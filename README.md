# FizzBuzz - In Objective-C

As part of a required test protocol, we are required to inform you that you
should be able to program the same identical program in multiple
implementation languages.

This one is Objective-C, originally designed by Tom Love and Brad Cox
at Productivity Products International (Later StepStone).
It was later popularized at NeXT in 1988 and used as the primary language for
the NeXTSTEP OS.
